# YourFireDiary
A little Django-Webapp for logging fire operations.

This small webapp was created using Django and Bootstrap.

You can use it to write down your firefighting operations.

You can log in online using the link in the description or you can run it locally. For this you need to install Python, DjangoFramework and django-bootstrap4.

If you are in the ffdiary path you can start the development server with the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## It is currently still under development. But the basic functions work.
